# Icon Files

This directory contains the extension icons in different sizes:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16px icon for the extension toolbar
- `icon48.png` - 48x48px icon for the extensions management page
- `icon128.png` - 128x128px icon for the Chrome Web Store

## Creating Icons

You can create your own icons or use an online icon generator. The icons should:

1. Be simple and recognizable at small sizes
2. Use colors that work well with both light and dark themes
3. Be in PNG format with transparent backgrounds
4. Follow the recommended sizes exactly

## Temporary Placeholder

For now, you can use any 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG images. Here are some options:

1. Create simple colored squares as placeholders
2. Use an online icon generator like favicon.io
3. Design custom icons that represent SCRUM/Agile (like a sprint board icon)

## Suggested Icon Theme

Consider using:
- Colors: Blue/Purple gradient (matching the extension theme)
- Symbol: A checklist, sprint board, or clock icon to represent daily standups
- Style: Modern, flat design with rounded corners


## Future 
- Add a way to customize JQL
